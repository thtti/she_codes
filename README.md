This repository contains all of my completed projects from the **SheCodes workshops**, part of my journey to earn a **Front-End Development Certificate**.

## ðŸ§  About the Workshops

SheCodes offers a structured learning path for beginners and aspiring developers. The workshops combine theory and hands-on practice to build real-world coding skills. Each step introduces new technologies and concepts, including:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics  
- Responsive design principles  
- Developer tools and debugging  
- Using APIs and advanced JS logic  
- Version control with Git & GitHub  
- Creating and deploying interactive web projects  

## ðŸ§ª My Learning Journey

This repository showcases my work and growth throughout the program. Every project here is built from scratch, guided by the workshop challenges but shaped by my personal creativity.
